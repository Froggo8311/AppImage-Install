# AppImage-Install
Script to install AppImages

usage: 

`./app-image-install.sh  ~/Downloads/my-appimage.AppImage"`

---

## NOTE

This script will install AppImages to ~/Applications.

It will add an entry to the gnome applications menu along with the app icon.

This has been tested on Pop!OS 22.04.

I assume it will work on other Ubuntu derivatives with Gnome... open an issue if it doesn't work on an OS or DE you care about.

Or feel free to submit a PR.
